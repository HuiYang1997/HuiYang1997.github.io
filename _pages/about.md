Welcome to Dr. Hui Yang's online home!

My research focuses on ontology modularization and the embedding of ontologies.

I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Manchester, where I work under the supervision of Dr. Jiaoyan Chen. My research interests include ontology embeddings and modularization. Prior to this, I completed my PhD at the LISN Laboratory at the University of Paris-Saclay, under the guidance of Dr. Yue Ma and Professor Nicole Bidoit.
